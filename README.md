- **Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you would’ve approached the design and problem solving process.**
  - We looked at the code I had made during the Flashcards project to get a basic understanding as to how to format the game. We also found resources on gets.chomp, and did some research on terminal games and command line inputs and outputs.
- **If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?**
  - I’d like to get more of iteration 4 working. I also feel there is probably more refactoring to do.
- **Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.**
  - We used ping pong for the first parts of iteration 1, then driver-navigator for the majority of the rest of the project. There were a few points when we would both feel sufficiently stuck and try to tackle the same problems independently, before coming back together to share what we had found.
- **Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.**
  - We called for a few hours every day; most of our feedback was given face-to-face. Some of it was also sent over Slack
